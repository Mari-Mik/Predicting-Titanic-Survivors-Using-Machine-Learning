## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Cleaned and processed the Titanic dataset from Kaggle
- 📊 Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- 🧠 Engineered features like Age Group and Family Size
- ⚖️ Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- 🤖 Trained and compared three models:
  - Tuned **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**

## 📈 Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy | Recall (1) | Precision (1) | F1 Score (1) |
|--------------------|----------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression| 79.39%   | **84%**     | 68.85%         | 75.68%       |
| Random Forest      | 76.72%   | 72%         | 68.57%         | 70.24%       |
| XGBoost            | **82.44%** | 78%      | **76.47%**     | **77.23%**   |

📌 **Conclusion:** XGBoost gave the most balanced and accurate results, while Logistic Regression achieved the best recall, important when predicting survivors.
